Send is a library for streaming files from the file system as a http response
supporting partial responses (Ranges), conditional-GET negotiation (If-Match,
If-Unmodified-Since, If-None-Match, If-Modified-Since), high test coverage,
and granular events which may be leveraged to take appropriate actions in your
application or framework.

## Installation

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). Installation is done using the
[`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

```bash
$ npm install send
```

## API

<!-- eslint-disable no-unused-vars -->

```js
var send = require('send')
```

### send(req, path, [options])

Create a new `SendStream` for the given path to send to a `res`. The `req` is
the Node.js HTTP request and the `path` is a urlencoded path to send (urlencoded,
not the actual file-system path).

#### Options

##### acceptRanges

Enable or disable accepting ranged requests, defaults to true.
Disabling this will not send `Accept-Ranges` and ignore the contents
of the `Range` request header.

##### cacheControl

Enable or disable setting `Cache-Control` response header, defaults to
true. Disabling this will ignore the `immutable` and `maxAge` options.

##### dotfiles

Set how "dotfiles" are treated when encountered. A dotfile is a file
or directory that begins with a dot ("."). Note this check is done on
the path itself without checking if the path actually exists on the
disk. If `root` is specified, only the dotfiles above the root are
checked (i.e. the root itself can be within a dotfile when when set
to "deny").

  - `'allow'` No special treatment for dotfiles.
  - `'deny'` Send a 403 for any request for a dotfile.
  - `'ignore'` Pretend like the dotfile does not exist and 404.

The default value is _similar_ to `'ignore'`, with the exception that
this default will not ignore the files within a directory that begins
with a dot, for backward-compatibility.

##### end

Byte offset at which the stream ends, defaults to the length of the file
minus 1. The end is inclusive in the stream, meaning `end: 3` will include
the 4th byte in the stream.

##### etag

Enable or disable etag generation, defaults to true.

##### extensions

If a given file doesn't exist, try appending one of the given extensions,
in the given order. By default, this is disabled (set to `false`). An
example value that will serve extension-less HTML files: `['html', 'htm']`.
This is skipped if the requested file already has an extension.

##### immutable

Enable or diable the `immutable` directive in the `Cache-Control` response
header, defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, the `maxAge` option should
also be specified to enable caching. The `immutable` directive will prevent
supported cl
