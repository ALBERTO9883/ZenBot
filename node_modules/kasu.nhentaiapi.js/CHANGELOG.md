# 2.9.0

## New Update
### Added new `IsDiscord`
* It blocks some selected tags that violate Discord rules.
If the doujin has those tags it will throw an error. So that you will need to
execute another one again until that doujin has a clean tags.
- Added the `ReRollonFail` bool for this specific new feature.
- this feature is credited to [crackheadakira](https://github.com/crackheadakira)
`getID()` update:
- the function `list()` is now removed so you can now only use 1 function `json()`
this will cause changes on some codes that uses `list()` like `data.cover` is now `data.images.cover` see more on the [README](https://github.com/IchimakiKasura/kasu.nhentaiapi.js/blob/main/README.md) page 
- You can now download the mini file version of this 2.9 [here](https://github.com/IchimakiKasura/kasu.nhentaiapi.js/releases/tag/2.9.0)

- Problem right now after publishing 2.9:<br>
the function `pRandom` has something weird saying `link is not defined` this will be fixed soon

different names has calling function so less space.
